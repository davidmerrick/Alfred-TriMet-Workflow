Pressing â†µ on either of these options will take you to the [Transit Tracker](https://trimet.org/#/tracker) page for that stop.

# Configuration

First, get an API key from [here](https://developer.trimet.org/appid/registration/).

Copy the `config.example.json` file to `config.json`. Add your API key in the `trimetApiKey` field.

Finally, configure the bus stops you're interested in, and add custom labels for them. Invoke this workflow by typing, `bus`.

Happy commuting!
